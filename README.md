# imgToByteArray
Convert image to byte array.

Installation:
Clone it and install deps with

    git clone https://github.com/david1983/imgToByteArray.git && cd imgToByteArray && npm install

Run with

    node app.js

The App is really simple ,allows to convert an img (color or bw) to monochromatic array of bytes (that I use to render on LCS/OLED screen with arduino).
The code is not really elegant but it does the job.
